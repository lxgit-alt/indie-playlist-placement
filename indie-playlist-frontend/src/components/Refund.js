1. Overview
This Refund Policy explains the conditions under which Indie Playlist Placement will provide refunds for subscription fees and other services.

2. Subscription Refunds

Free Plan: No payment is made; therefore, refunds do not apply.
Pro Plan:
Subscription fees are billed monthly.
Refunds will be provided only if a technical issue prevents you from accessing Pro features for a continuous 24-hour period.
To request a refund, you must contact our support team within 7 days of the billing cycle. Refunds will be processed on a case-by-case basis.
3. One-Time Service Fees
If you are charged a one-time fee for a service and experience a problem that prevents service delivery, contact support within 14 days of purchase to request a refund.

4. How to Request a Refund

Contact Support:
Email: support@indieplaylistplacement.com
Include details such as your account information, transaction ID, and a description of the issue.
Evaluation:
We will investigate your request and, if approved, process the refund within 7-10 business days.
5. Non-Refundable Items

Once a service has been delivered in full, or if a substantial portion of the service has been provided, the fee may be non-refundable.
Promotional discounts and credits are non-refundable.
6. Modifications to Refund Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on the Site and will be effective immediately upon posting.
